					<p>This book is a crash course in using the command line to make your computer do things. As a crash course, it’s not as detailed or extensive as my other books. It is simply designed to get you barely capable enough to start using your computer like a real programmer does. When you’re done with it, you will be able to give most of the basic commands that every shell user touches every day. You’ll understand the basics of directories and a few other concepts.</p>
